                        jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. 
                        It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. 
                        With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

                History slides 1995 - Javascript created at netscape (in 10 days). Deployed in Netscape Navigator 2.0 1996 - Microsoft reverse
                engineers javascript and creates JScript. Deployed in Internet Explorer 3 (IE3) 1996 - Start of first browser
                war (differences between javascript and JScript made it difficult for designers and programers to work with
                both) image of first browser war 1996 - Netscape submits javascript to ECMA international to create and maintain
                a specification 1997 - ECMAScript (ES) first published with javascript being the most well know implementation
                1999 - ES3 released. This is the baseline for modern day javascript 1999 - IE5 released. Supports ES3 but
                still uses JScript over javascript. 2004 - Firefox (Successor to Netscape Navigator) is released using javascript
                supporting the ES3 spec 2006 - jQuery released notes - Wild west where people would flat out break rules
                in the ES3 spec - Doing simple things required lots of boiler plate code so people would make libraries to
                help reduce amount they had to write - jQuery quickly became adopted by frustrated developers to quickly
                write code that worked consistently across the browsers 2008 - Microsoft announces support for jQuery and
                distribute with Visual Studio. jQuery is even more widely adopted. 2008 - Microsoft, yahoo and google dissent
                from ES4 resulting it being shelved. 2009 - ES5 is finalized with less adventurous changes but lots of quality
                of life changes. image of second browser war 2012 - IE10 released. Powered by JScript. Fully supports ES5
                2012 - Chrome fully supports ES5 2013 - Firefox fully supports ES5 - Things become a lot more consistent
                here 2015 - IE11 released. Still powered by JScript. 2015 - ECMAScript 6 is finalized and browser support
                is still incomplete without jumping through a few hoops 2016 - Microsoft announces only security updates
                will be created for IE11. No new feature releases. 2016 - Microsoft Edge is released and is powered by Javascript
                fully supporting ES5 and partially supporting ES6 2017 - ECMAScript 7 is finalized and has partial support
